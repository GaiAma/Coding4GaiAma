# gaiama-slugger

## Not yet released!

It's an opinionated slugger wrapping [@sindresorhus/slugify](https://github.com/sindresorhus/slugify).  
It pre-defines settings and adds a counter to handle multiple occurrences of the same slug.  
This feature is already being discussed in [#37](https://github.com/sindresorhus/slugify/issues/37) so it might end up in "upstream" soon-ish. 🤷‍♂️

This package is basically to satisfy our requirements and ensure consistency.  
If tests start to fail only this package has to be fixed. 😉
