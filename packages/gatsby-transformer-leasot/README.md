# EXPERIMENTAL

create empty state/fallback via emptyState option or always ensure a TODO: comment somewhere ðŸ˜‰

set emptyState to null if you want to disable it, bear in mind that you always have to ensure at least one matching comment is being sourced to avoid crashes

<!-- TODO: createTypes to ensure emptyState just returns nothing instead of erroring -->
