# Contributing

First, thank you for contributing! ðŸŽ‰

The local development workflow is fairly straightfowrad:

1. Fork the repo and then git clone your fork locally (be sure to work on a new branch, not on your `master` branch)
1. `npm install`
1. `npm run dev` this will start the source build watcher and install/start the example app for you
1. Then you can view the example app running at http://localhost:3000. Changes you make to the source will compile and hot-reload
