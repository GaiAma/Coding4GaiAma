/**
 * When shipping NPM modules, they typically need to be either
 * pre-compiled or the user needs to add bundler config to process the
 * files. Gatsby lets us ship the bundler config *with* the theme, so
 * we never need a lib-side build step.  Since we dont pre-compile the
 * theme, this is how we let webpack know how to process files.
 *
