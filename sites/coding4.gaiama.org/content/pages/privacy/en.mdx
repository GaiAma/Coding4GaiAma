# Privacy Policy

April 28, 2019

Personal data (usually referred to just as "data" below) will only be processed by us to the extent necessary and for the purpose of providing a functional and user-friendly website, including its contents, and the services offered there.

Per Art. 4 No. 1 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, i.e. the General Data Protection Regulation (hereinafter referred to as the "GDPR"), "processing" refers to any operation or set of operations such as collection, recording, organization, structuring, storage, adaptation, alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination, or otherwise making available, alignment, or combination, restriction, erasure, or destruction performed on personal data, whether by automated means or not.

The following privacy policy is intended to inform you in particular about the type, scope, purpose, duration, and legal basis for the processing of such data either under our own control or in conjunction with others. We also inform you below about the third-party components we use to optimize our website and improve the user experience which may result in said third parties also processing data they collect and control.

Our privacy policy is structured as follows:

[I. Information about us as controllers of your data](#i-information-about-us-as-controllers-of-your-data)  
[II. The rights of users and data subjects](#ii-the-rights-of-users-and-data-subjects)  
[III. Information about the data processing](#iii-information-about-the-data-processing)

### I. Information about us as controllers of your data

The party responsible for this website (the "controller") for purposes of data protection law is:

Asociación GaiAma

Jr. José Maria Arguedas J-13  
Urb. Sta Mónica Wanchaq, Cusco

### II. The rights of users and data subjects

With regard to the data processing to be described in more detail below, users and data subjects have the right

- to confirmation of whether data concerning them is being processed, information about the data being processed, further information about the nature of the data processing, and copies of the data (cf. also Art. 15 GDPR);
- to correct or complete incorrect or incomplete data (cf. also Art. 16 GDPR);
- to the immediate deletion of data concerning them (cf. also Art. 17 DSGVO), or, alternatively, if further processing is necessary as stipulated in Art. 17 Para. 3 GDPR, to restrict said processing per Art. 18 GDPR;
- to receive copies of the data concerning them and/or provided by them and to have the same transmitted to other providers/controllers (cf. also Art. 20 GDPR);
- to file complaints with the supervisory authority if they believe that data concerning them is being processed by the controller in breach of data protection provisions (see also Art. 77 GDPR).

In addition, the controller is obliged to inform all recipients to whom it discloses data of any such corrections, deletions, or restrictions placed on processing the same per Art. 16, 17 Para. 1, 18 GDPR. However, this obligation does not apply if such notification is impossible or involves a disproportionate effort. Nevertheless, users have a right to information about these recipients.

**Likewise, under Art. 21 GDPR, users and data subjects have the right to object to the controller's future processing of their data pursuant to Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f) GDPR. In particular, an objection to data processing for the purpose of direct advertising is permissible.**

### III. Information about the data processing

Your data processed when using our website will be deleted or blocked as soon as the purpose for its storage ceases to apply, provided the deletion of the same is not in breach of any statutory storage obligations or unless otherwise stipulated below.

#### Server data

For technical reasons, the following data sent by your internet browser to us or to our server provider [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) will be collected, especially to ensure a secure and stable website: These server log files record the type and version of your browser, operating system, the website from which you came (referrer URL), the webpages on our site visited, the date and time of your visit, as well as the IP address from which you visited our site.

The data thus collected will be stored for less than 30 days, but not in association with any other of your data.

The basis for this storage is Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f) GDPR. Our legitimate interest lies in the improvement, stability, functionality, and security of our website.

The data will be deleted within no more than seven days, unless continued storage is required for evidentiary purposes. In which case, all or part of the data will be excluded from deletion until the investigation of the relevant incident is finally resolved.

The form uses the so called localStorage, [read more below](#localStorage)

The legal basis for this data processing is Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. b) GDPR.

We offer you the opportunity to register for our free newsletter via our website. We use SparkPost, a service of Message Systems, Inc. (dba SparkPost), 9160 Guilford Rd., Columbia, Maryland 21046, USA, hereinafter referred to as "SparkPost".

#### YouTube

We use YouTube on our website. This is a video portal operated by YouTube LLC, 901 Cherry Ave, 94066 San Bruno, CA, USA, hereinafter referred to as "YouTube".

YouTube is a subsidiary of Google LLC, 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043 USA, hereinafter referred to as "Google".

Through [certification](https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt000000001L5AAI) according to the EU-US Privacy Shield Google and its subsidiary YouTube guarantee that they will follow the EU's data protection regulations when processing data in the United States.

We use YouTube in its advanced privacy mode (recognizable by the url youtube-nocookie.com) to show you videos. The legal basis is Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f) GDPR. Our legitimate interest lies in improving the quality of our website. According to YouTube, the advanced privacy mode means that the data specified below will only be transmitted to the YouTube server if you actually start a video.

Without this mode, a connection to the YouTube server in the USA will be established as soon as you access any of our webpages on which a YouTube video is embedded.

This connection is required in order to be able to display the respective video on our website within your browser. YouTube will record and process at a minimum your IP address, the date and time the video was displayed, as well as the website you visited. In addition, a connection to the DoubleClick advertising network of Google is established.

If you are logged in to YouTube when you access our site, YouTube will assign the connection information to your YouTube account. To prevent this, you must either log out of YouTube before visiting our site or make the appropriate settings in your YouTube account.

For the purpose of functionality and analysis of usage behavior, YouTube permanently stores cookies on your device via your browser. If you do not agree to this processing, you have the option of preventing the installation of cookies by making the appropriate settings in your browser.

Further information about the collection and use of data as well as your rights and protection options in Google's privacy policy found at [policies.google.com/privacy](https://policies.google.com/privacy)

#### Vimeo

We use Vimeo to display videos on our website. This is a service of Vimeo, LLC, 555 West 18th Street, New York, New York 10011, USA, hereinafter referred to as "Vimeo."

Some of the user data is processed on Vimeo servers in the USA. Through [certification](https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt00000008V77AAE&status=Active) according to the EU-US Privacy Shield Vimeo guarantees that it will follow the EU's data protection regulations when processing data in the United States.

The legal basis for collecting and processing this information is Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f) GDPR. Our legitimate interest lies in improving the quality of our website.

When you access a page on our website that has Vimeo embedded in it, a connection to Vimeo's servers in the USA is established. For technical reasons, it is necessary for Vimeo to process your IP address. In addition, the date and time of your visit to our website will also be recorded.

If you are logged into Vimeo while visiting one of our webpages containing a Vimeo video, Vimeo will associate information about your interaction with our site to your Vimeo account. If you wish to prevent this, you must either log out of Vimeo before visiting our website or configure your Vimeo user account accordingly.

For the purpose of functionality and usage analysis, Vimeo uses Google Analytics. Google Analytics stores cookies on your terminal device via your browser and transmits information about the use of those websites in which a Vimeo video is embedded to Google. It is possible that Google will process this information in the USA.

If you do not agree to this processing, you have the option of preventing the installation of cookies by making the appropriate settings in your browser. Further details can be found in the section about cookies above.

The legal basis for collecting and processing this information is Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f) GDPR. Our legitimate interest lies in improving the quality of our website and in Vimeo's legitimate interest in statistically analyzing user behavior for optimization and marketing purposes.

Vimeo offers further information about its data collection and processing as well your rights and your options for protecting your privacy at this link: [vimeo.com/privacy](https://vimeo.com/privacy).

#### Google Analytics

We use Google Analytics on our website. This is a web analytics service provided by Google Inc., Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Irland (hereinafter: Google).

Through [certification](https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt000000001L5AAI&status=Active) according to the EU-US Privacy Shield Google guarantees that it will follow the EU's data protection regulations when processing data in the United States.

The Google Analytics service is used to analyze how our website is used. The legal basis is Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f) GDPR. Our legitimate interest lies in the analysis, optimization, and economic operation of our site.

Usage and user-related information, such as IP address, place, time, or frequency of your visits to our website will be transmitted to a Google server in the United States and stored there. However, we use Google Analytics with the so-called anonymization function, whereby Google truncates the IP address within the EU or the EEA before it is transmitted to the US.

The data collected in this way is in turn used by Google to provide us with an evaluation of visits to our website and what visitors do once there. This data can also be used to provide other services related to the use of our website and of the internet in general.

Google states that it will not connect your IP address to other data. In addition, Google provides further information with regard to its data protection practices at [google.com/intl/de/policies/privacy/partners,](https://www.google.com/intl/de/policies/privacy/partners) including options you can exercise to prevent such use of your data.

In addition, Google offers an opt-out add-on at [tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=de)

in addition with further information. This add-on can be installed on the most popular browsers and offers you further control over the data that Google collects when you visit our website. The add-on informs Google Analytics' JavaScript (ga.js) that no information about the website visit should be transmitted to Google Analytics. However, this does not prevent information from being transmitted to us or to other web analytics services we may use as detailed herein.

#### localStorage

Our forms use the so called localStorage provided by your browser to cache small amounts of data. We use this functionality to backup data you enter in our forms to prevent them from data loss, which might happen due to connection problems, page reload, etc. Each form has its own entry in the localStorage to be synchronised with. We prefill the form automatically if you refresh the page or a submission fails. The cache will be cleared if you manually delete the content of the fields and after a successful submission.

#### What about Facebook and other social Networks?

You might be wondering why we're nowhere talking about our use of social links like Facebook or no mentioning about analytical services like Google Analytics. Even though we're using all of those services, we'e not giving them any personally identifiable information (PII). This works because we're using our own implementations, instead of the officialy provided ones.

All social links you see on our website are pure HTML links. Only by explicitly clicking them, which results in a redirect or new tab being opened to the respective service, will allow them access to your data and from this point on the privacy policy of the service applies.

Our use of Google Analytics is similar. Our website doesn't talk to Google's servers directly. We built our own little "gatekeeper" which receives only information we provide, which includes the site url you're currently visiting and a randomly generated id to group multiple requests, none of which contain any personally identifable information. Our gatekeeper will then hand those information over to Google Analytics for us to review. This system won't give us accurate user statistics, but rather an idea about which pages and articles are mostly clicked.

The fonts we use are originally from Google's Font collection. As we store them on our servers, Google won't get access to your personal data.
