Thanks to this amazing SO (StackOverflow) [answer to the question "Github GraphQL to recursively list all files in the directory"](https://stackoverflow.com/a/46683303/3484824) I finally got my query working üòÉ

The query works only using the [gatsby-source-graphql](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-source-graphql/) plugin.  
If you want to use it outside Gatsby remove the `GitHub_` prefixes so it becomes `GitObjectID`, `Tree` and `Blob`, haven't tested it elsewhere though.

```graphql
query($branch: GitHub_GitObjectID) {
  github {
    viewer {
      repository(name: "Coding4GaiAma") {
        name
        object(expression: "master:", oid: $branch) {
          ... on GitHub_Tree {
            entries {
              name
              object {
                ... on GitHub_Blob {
                  text
                }
              }
            }
          }
        }
        issues(first: 10, filterBy: { states: OPEN }) {
          nodes {
            title
            url
            bodyText
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Would love to know if you're going to use it in a project üôè
